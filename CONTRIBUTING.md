# Contributing to TFM

This is meant to be a community effort so 
contributions are important to us!

## Getting Started

If you have a tip, trick, or guide to share 
the best way to get it included is to just 
open a pull requests. If you want to contribute but
don't know what to add, checkout the issues tab of our git
repo to see if there are any open issues that you have knowledge about.


### Before you begin

- Make sure you have read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Familiarize yourself with the format we use to organize the information on TFM.
- Make sure you aren't duplicating info that already exists. 
- If you are modifying, updating, or clarifying existing information make sure you explain why you are doing so in your PR. 


### Format

In order to keep things organized and useful we request
that all PR's conform to the same format as other pages/sections. 
In the near future we will have a set of templates to guide you with 
the creation of your addition.

## Requesting a new page, section, or topic

If you think of something that would be useful to the community
but you don't have the knowledge yourself, if you are absolutely sure
the info doesn't already exist on TFM, you can open an issue to request
help from the community with adding it to the repository. Be as specific as
you can about what you are proposing. Generic issues will be closed as unhelpful.
