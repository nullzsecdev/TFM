# The F-ing Manual

TFM is a collection of tips, tricks, and guides for all things relating to CTF's, red-teaming, pentesting, and just hacking in general. 

## Why TFM?
We chose this name because this should be the first place you head whenever anyone tells you to just RTFM (Read The F-ing Manual).


## Inspiration
The main inspiration for TFM came from the outstanding [Hack Tricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz). Many of the tips found in here likely came from there, any which did will have a citation and a link to the original. We highly encourage you to donate to that project if you found any of the referenced tips useful.

## Who is NullzSec?

We are a community of IT professionals, software engineers, CTF players, and pretty much any other type of hacker you can think of. We sometimes compete in CTF's as a team, and on any given day you'll find many of us on sites like [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).
